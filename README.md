The repository includes a data science project as part of the course "Introduction to R"

The project is developed using R as the programming language. Tableau is used for data visualization.

The dataset that we used is taken from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction


THE WHY

The purpose of this project was to put to test the learnings and skills related to R specifically exploring the following topics using R:

Statistics, Regression, Supervised Clustering, Unsupervised Clustering, Forecasting


Some sample question examples which aligned with the aforementioned topics that we tried to answer were:

What is the average home price in the zip code 98034 and what is the standard deviation.

What are the best predictors for home price from the ones in the file? Show the model.

Cluster the data using your choice of columns and number of bedrooms as the dependent variable.

Cluster the data using these columns: bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living, floors, waterfront, price. Name the clusters.

Does the model improve if instead of a linear model we use a neural network?

What is the expected average home price for January 2016 based on the average home prices from previous months?
